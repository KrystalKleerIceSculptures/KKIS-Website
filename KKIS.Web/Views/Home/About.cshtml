                Krystal Kleer Ice Sculptures was founded as a part-time business in 1988 by Paul
                Salmon while he was working as a chef in Green Bay, WI. The business moved to Appleton,
                WI in 1994. In 1998 Krystal Kleer became a full-time career for Paul.

                Paul attributes his talent to God our creator, and strives to honor Him through
                his talent as a carver.
